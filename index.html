      and the Furious' franchise.

      <h3>Facts</h3>

        <li>
          Paul Walker was a very giving, charitable individual. He was not one
          of these Hollywood stars who only thought about himself. He tried to
          help wildlife (sharks, mainly), as well as people around the world.

        <li>
          The Paul Walker we know and love is actually Paul William Walker the
          IV and his grandfather, Paul Williams II was a professional boxer who
          went by the name "Irish" Billy Walker. He was a heavyweight whose
          (other) nickname was “Golden Boy” and his professional record was 21
          wins (16 by knockout), 8 losses, and 2 draws.
        </li>
        <li>
          Paul Walker was a true car buff—not just in the Fast and Furious
          movies, but in real life, too. It can’t be stated enough but it can be
          proven when we look at car-related things in his life. For instance,
          he owned a high-end performance car shop, called Always Evolving.
